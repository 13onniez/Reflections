- git remote || shows all git remotes
- git remote add <origin> < github url of repository > || creates new remotes
- git remote -v || shows url to fetch/push
- git push (name of remote to send changes to, local branch you want to push)
	e.g git push origin master

Q1:
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- when you want to share your repository with other people (collaboration)
